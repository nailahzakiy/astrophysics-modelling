# 🌌 Astrophysics Modelling

Welcome to **Astrophysics Modelling** , a personal playground where I explore the structure and behavior of celestial objects using code 🪐✨

This repository includes:
- 🔭 Theoretical simulations using the **Lane-Emden equation** and **stellar structure models**
- 🧠 Applications of **Machine Learning** in astrophysics
- 📊 Data visualization with **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, and more
- 🧮 Numerical modeling with **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **SymPy**
- 🌠 Ongoing experiments on energy transport, radiative zones, and more!

## 🚀 Motivation

Understanding stars from first principles is not only beautiful, but also empowering. This repo serves as my digital sketchbook to:

- Learn and implement classic astrophysical equations
- Visualize internal stellar processes and their evolution
- Experiment with modern tools (like ML) to explore the universe in new ways
